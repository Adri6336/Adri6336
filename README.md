Heyo! I'm a B.S. Software Development student looking to try and get some computer skills to hopefully get a livable wage before the *inevitable* human obsolescence. This GitHub account, while def tryna show off some of my progress to potential employers, is mostly a place for me to share the things I work on out of boredom or procrastination. 

The main languages I work with are Python (for its ease and versatility) and Kotlin (so I can make Android apps every now and then). Else to those, I may use other languages sporadically if I find a need (like once I used Go Lang to create an AES-256 cipher because the available Python module would append a plaintext signature to the file, messing up my ability to use steganography a bit).
