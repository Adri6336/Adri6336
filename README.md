### Welcome to My Coding Universe! ✨

I'm a B.S. Software Engineering student striving to hone my computer science prowess and secure a vibrant career in tech before automation takes the wheel. This GitHub repository is a canvas for my learning journey, showcasing my development to future employers, and doubling as my playground for innovative experiments born from sheer curiosity or the occasional procrastination.

Primarily, my tools of choice are **Python**, celebrated for its simplicity and broad-reaching applications, and **Kotlin**, my gateway to crafting sleek Android applications. My exploratory nature leads me to dabble in other technologies, too. I wielded **Go Lang** once to set up an AES-256 cipher—simply because the Python alternative didn't work with the available steganography tool.
